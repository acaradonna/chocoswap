# Chocoswap 🍫

A decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Ethereum, featuring AMM functionality, protocol fee collection, and staking rewards.

## 🎯 Project Status

**Current Phase:** MVP to Testnet Launch  
**Target Network:** Ethereum Sepolia / Base Sepolia  
**License:** MIT (frontend), GPL-3.0-or-later (contracts)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **ChocoToken (CHOCO)**: ERC20 governance and utility token with minting controls
- **AMM**: Uniswap v2-style Factory/Pair contracts with protocol fee integration  
- **FeeCollector**: Collects protocol fees as LP tokens and distributes to Treasury/Rewards
- **MasterChef**: Staking pools for LP tokens with CHOCO emissions
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript interface with wagmi/viem/RainbowKit

### Data Flow

1. Swaps generate protocol fees collected as LP tokens
2. FeeCollector periodically converts LP → underlying tokens → Treasury/Rewards split
3. Users stake LP tokens in MasterChef pools to earn CHOCO rewards
4. CHOCO emissions controlled by configurable schedule and pool weights

## 🛣️ Roadmap

We're following a structured milestone approach from MVP to testnet launch:

- **M0**: Repository hardening and CI/CD ✅
- **M1**: AMM integration (Uniswap v2 + FeeCollector) 🚧
- **M2**: Staking pools and CHOCO emissions 📋
- **M3**: Frontend MVP (swap, liquidity, staking) 📋
- **M4**: Testnet deployment and QA 📋
- **M5**: Security review and hardening 📋
- **M6**: Beta testnet launch + feedback 📋
